This website is the homepage of the joint project "LLM4HW" which explores how LLMs can best be used in the pursuit of hardware and digital design. This includes LLMs for writing Verilog, VHDL, and other HDLs, the use of LLMs to assist with Electronic Design Automation, and LLMs to assist with hardware bug-finding and repair.
