        <h3>Explaining EDA synthesis errors with LLMs</h3>
        <p>ISLAD'24</p>
        <p>Training new engineers in digital design is a challenge, particularly when it comes to teaching the complex electronic design automation (EDA) tooling used in this domain. Learners will typically deploy designs in the Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) from Altera (Intel) and Xilinx (AMD) via proprietary closed-source toolchains (Quartus Prime and Vivado, respectively)....</p>
