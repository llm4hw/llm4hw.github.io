        <h3>Explaining EDA synthesis errors with LLMs</h3>
        <p class="authors">Siyu Qiu, Benjamin Tan, Hammond Pearce</p>
        <p>ISLAD'24</p>
        <p>Training new engineers in digital design is a challenge, particularly when it comes to teaching the complex electronic design automation (EDA) tooling used in this domain. Learners will typically deploy designs in the Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) from Altera (Intel) and Xilinx (AMD) via proprietary closed-source toolchains (Quartus Prime and Vivado, respectively)....</p>

        <h3>Evaluating LLMs for Hardware Design and Test</h3>
        <p class="authors">Jason Blocklove, Siddharth Garg, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce</p>
        <p>ISLAD'24</p>
        <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities for producing code in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). However, most of the focus remains on their abilities to write functional code, not test code. The hardware design process consists of both design and test....</p>

        <h3>Verigen: A large language model for verilog code generation</h3>
        <p class="authors">Shailja Thakur, Baleegh Ahmad, Hammond Pearce, Benjamin Tan, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, Ramesh Karri, Siddharth Garg</p>
        <p>ACM</p>
        <p>In this study, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate hardware design by automatically completing partial Verilog code, a common language for designing and modeling digital systems. We fine-tune pre-existing LLMs on Verilog datasets compiled from GitHub and Verilog textbooks....</p>

        <h3>On hardware security bug code fixes by prompting large language models</h3>
        <p class="authors">Baleegh Ahmad, Shailja Thakur, Benjamin Tan, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce</p>
        <p>IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security</p>
        <p>Novel AI-based code-writing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s Codex have demonstrated capabilities in many coding-adjacent domains. In this work, we consider how LLMs may be leveraged to automatically repair identified security-relevant bugs present in hardware designs by generating replacement code...</p>

        <h3>Chip-Chat: Challenges and Opportunities in Conversational Hardware Design</h3>
        <p class="authors">Jason Blocklove, Siddharth Garg, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce</p>
        <p>MLCAD'23</p>
        <p>Modern hardware design starts with specifications provided in natural language. These are then translated by hardware engineers into appropriate Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog before synthesizing circuit elements. Automating this translation could reduce sources of human error from the engineering process. But, it is only recently that artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated capabilities for machine-based end-to-end design translations.....</p>
