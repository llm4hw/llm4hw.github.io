## Using the CSE Virtual Machine
    
For users using the CSE virtual machine, the Vivado environment is pre-configured, and the plugin tool is already set up for you. However, before you use the tool, you need to type
```
set env(TCL_LIBRARY) "C:\\Program Files\\Python312\\tcl\\tcl8.6"
set env(TK_LIBRARY) "C:\\Program Files\\Python312\\tcl\\tcl8.6"
```
to the TCL console first to ensure everything is working correctly.

After entering those two commands, the plugin tool is ready.

**HITS:** All the request file are in "C:\Users\cse\AppData\Local\LLM4HW"
